You were the best PHP developer there. We love you so much.
You were the hope for our humanity, please come back we wanna see that smexy face.
You were almost as good as Civiled.
Mashallah, Brother Ani.
Asylum Gang misses you, Ani-chan! Please come back!
Ani, let's have an orgy! We await your return baby. :heart:
You were one of the nicest guys in the PMMP community.
You are almost as good at civiled but not quite so little boy sit down with yo "Where do I start programming" and "What language should I learn first" headass.
When you come back, work on Galactic! (You're still the GOAT at PHP development)
You were very fuckable, Ani! 10/10 nice booty af
Scarce says: I liked Ani, he was really nice.
Come back so you can argue about coding languages with us, Ani-chan!
You were so precious and Indian, we were so sad when we lost you.
Please come back so we don't have to deal with Scarce's "I'M A PHP God BS." Please put him in his place...
We have a marriage with JTJamez awaiting you. Please come back, don't leave us babygirl.
Please come back so you can complain about Sinkerz's unneeded waifu addiction.
