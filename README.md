# Good Wishes for Ani

After October 30th, Ani was never seen again. It has now been concluded that Ani is dead,
and to revive his spirit,  we must send him good wishes. Use this bot to message Ani 
every hour a nice message and pray that he will be home one day.

Add more lines to sentences.txt and the closer we will get to Ani. Every day, we stray
farther away from both god and Ani, and messaging him once a day will stop this from
happening any more.

# Where is Ani?

Some say he was kidnapped. Some say he commit suicide. His only goal with the dev role in
Developer Union, and now that he has it, he has no reason to live. The only way we can
bring him back is by sending good vibes his way or removing his dev role.
